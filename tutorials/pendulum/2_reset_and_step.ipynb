    "# Tutorial 2: Specifying the Reset and Step Function of the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how to create a gym environment using [EAGERx](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/) while specifying the [step function](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.step_fn) and [reset function](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset_fn).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial cover the following concepts of EAGERx:\n",
    "- Extracting observations in the [step_fn](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.step_fn)\n",
    "- Resetting states using the [reset_fn](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset_fn)\n",
    "- The `window` argument of the [connect method](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html?highlight=connect#eagerx.core.graph.Graph.connect)\n",
    "- Simulating delays using the `delay` argument of the [connect method](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html?highlight=connect#eagerx.core.graph.Graph.connect)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this tutorial we will go more into detail on these concepts.\n",

    "## Pendulum Swing-up\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create an environment for solving the classic control problem of swinging up an underactuated pendulum, very similar to the [Pendulum-v0 environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/).\n",
    "Our goal is to swing up this pendulum to the upright position and keep it there, while minimizing the velocity of the pendulum and the input voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dynamics of a pendulum actuated by a DC motor are well known, we can simulate the pendulum by integrating the corresponding ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta \\\\ \\dot{\\theta} \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{\\theta} \\\\ \\frac{1}{J}(\\frac{K}{R}u - mgl \\sin{\\theta} - b \\dot{\\theta} - \\frac{K^2}{R}\\dot{\\theta})\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\theta$ the angle w.r.t. upright position, $\\dot{\\theta}$ the angular velocity, $u$ the input voltage, $J$ the inertia, $m$ the mass, $g$ the gravitational constant, $l$ the length of the pendulum, $b$ the motor viscous friction constant, $K$ the motor constant and $R$ the electric resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to run the code, we need to install the *eagerx_tutorials* package and ROS."

    "When connecting outputs, sensors or actions, we can specify among other things the `window` of the connection.\n",

    "- `window` $= 1$: Only the last received input message are available to the receiver.\n",
    "- `window` $= x \\ge 1$: The trailing last $x$ received input messages are available to the receiver ($1 \\le$ received number of messages $\\le$ `window` ).\n",
    "- `window` $= 0$: All input messages received since the last call to the node's callback are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in particular relevant when connecting to observations, since it has consequences for the size of the observation space.\n",
    "When connecting to an observation with `window` $= 0$, this observation will **not** be included in the observation space of the agent, because its dimensions might change every time step and are therefore unknown on beforehand.\n",
    "Also worth noting, is that for observations if `window` $= x > 1$, at time step $t < x$, the first message is repeated $x - t$ times to ensure that the dimensions of the observation space are consistent."
