    "# Tutorial 1: EAGERx Environment Creation and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show a simple example of how to create a gym environment using [EAGERx](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",
    "Also, we will use this environment to train a policy using [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to show some of the key concepts of EAGERx:\n",
    "- Creating a [Graph](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html) with an [Object](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/object/index.html)\n",
    "- How to use this [Graph](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html) and a [Bridge](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/bridge/index.html) to create an [Eagerx Environment](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html)\n",
    "- How to train a policy with the [Eagerx Environment](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this tutorial we will go more into detail on these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pendulum Swing-up\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create an environment for solving the classic control problem of swinging up an underactuated pendulum, very similar to the [Pendulum-v0 environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/).\n",
    "Our goal is to swing up this pendulum to the upright position and keep it there, while minimizing the velocity of the pendulum and the input voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dynamics of a pendulum actuated by a DC motor are well known, we can simulate the pendulum by integrating its equations of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/eom.svg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "where theta is the angle w.r.t. upright position, theta dot the angular velocity, u the input voltage, J the inertia, m the mass, g the gravitational constant, l the length of the pendulum, b the motor viscous friction constant, K the motor constant and R the electric resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/pendulum.GIF\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that EAGERx makes use of ROS 1 functionality.\n",
    "Therefore ROS 1 should be [installed](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) on your system.\n",
    "Note that it should also be sourced:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where `<distro>` should be replaced with your ROS distribution, i.e. `melodic` or `noetic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to install the Python dependencies, i.e. using pip or from source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation using pip\n",
    "Furthermore, the Python dependencies can be installed by running (this will also install `eagerx`):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install eagerx-tutorials\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation from source\n",
    "Clone this repository:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:eager-dev/eagerx_tutorials.git ; cd eagerx_tutorials\n",
    "```\n",
    "then install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (if not installed yet):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -\n",
    "```\n",
    "Install this package and its dependencies using Poetry (will also install Jupyterlab if not yet installed):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry install\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then open Jupyter Notebook from within the Poetry environment\n",
